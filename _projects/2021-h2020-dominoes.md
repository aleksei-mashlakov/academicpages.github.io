### Project objective

DOMINOES project aimed to enable the discovery and development of new demand response, aggregation, grid management and peer-to-peer trading services by designing, developing, and validating a transparent and scalable local energy market solution.

### Project partners 

It is a European research project supported by Horizon 2020 and developed by *Enerim (coordinator – Finland)*, *E-REDES (CNET and EDP Distribution)*, *ISEP (GECAD)*, *Lappeenranta University of Technology – LUT (Finland)*, *VPS (UK)*, *University of Leicester – UoL (UK)*, and *University of Seville (Spain)*.

### My Role in the project

I was involved into the integration of LUT LVDC microgrids’ energy management systems (EMSs) to the local market service platform (LMSP) for validation of use case (UC) 5 “Local community flexibility and energy asset management for wholesale and energy system market value”. In this scenario, the aggregator offers flexibility of microgrids (*prosumers*) for sale to reserve markets through the local energy and flexibility market (LEFM). 

To integrate and validate the microgrids’ EMSs into the local market service platform (LMSP) environment, I have developed components of the aggregator platform including forecast, simulation & optimization, control, and settlement services. The results of the use case validation and description of the developed services are presented in [D4.3 Distribution Grid and Microgrid Validation Activities Report](http://dominoesproject.eu/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/D4.4_DOMINOES_-Distribution-gird-and-microgrid-validation-activities-report.pdf).
